	<h4>Context files</h4>
	The following JSON-LD context files are currently available:
	<div>
        <ul>
		<li><a href="contexts/personal_reading_log_context_lite.jsonld">personal_reading_log_context_lite.jsonld</a> - a context useful to make notes about read books including author, title, opinion and some other information.
		<li><a href="contexts/personal_reading_log_context_lite_pl.jsonld">personal_reading_log_context_lite_pl.jsonld</a> - a context useful to make notes about read books including author, title,

			opinion and some other information. Polish version. This context makes use an additional ontology which defines some literary concepts (genres, physical media, etc.)
	</ul>
	</div>
	<h4>Ontologies</h4>
	<div>
		<li><a href="ontologies/PublicationFormsOntology.ttl">PublicationFormsOntology.ttl</a> - an ontology that collects publication works types / genres useful for 
			expressing information about read books.
			I consider this ontology a work-in-progress which will evolve, however I'll try to keep the vocabulary as stable as possible.
		<li><a href="ontologies/PublicationFormsOntology_pl.ttl">PublicationFormsOntology_pl.ttl</a> - the same ontology as above (Polish version). 
			Watch out! This ontology contains Polish names of concepts/individuals to be easily used in JSON-LD descriptions.
			I consider this ontology a work-in-progress which will evolve, however I'll try to keep the vocabulary as stable as possible.
