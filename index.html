	<h4>Context files</h4>

	<div>
        <ul>
		<li><a href="contexts/personal_reading_log_context.jsonld">personal_reading_log_context.jsonld</a> - a context useful to make notes about 
	read books including author, title, opinion and some other information.
        This file will be further developed, esp. better concepts will proposed, however the current schema.org concepts are acceptable.
