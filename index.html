	<h1>Contexts and ontologies</h1>
	Here both contexts and ontologies are published to be used freely by all interested parties.
	The following contexts are currently available:

	<a href="contexts/personal_reading_log_context.jsonld"></a> - a context useful to make notes about read books including author, title, opinion and some other information.
This file will be further developed, esp. better concepts will proposed, however the current schema.org concepts are acceptable.
