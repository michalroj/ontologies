	Here both contexts and ontologies are published to be used freely by all interested parties.
	<h4>Context files</h4>
	The following JSON-LD context files are currently available:
	<div>
        <ul>
		<li><a href="contexts/personal_reading_log_context_lite.jsonld">personal_reading_log_context_lite.jsonld</a> - a context useful to make notes about read books including author, title, opinion and some other information.
		<li><a href="contexts/personal_reading_log_context_lite_pl.jsonld">personal_reading_log_context_lite_pl.jsonld</a> - a context useful to make notes about read books including author, title,
			opinion and some other information. Polish version.
		<li><a href="contexts/personal_reading_log_context_pl.jsonld">personal_reading_log_context_pl.jsonld</a> - like above, a context useful to make notes about read books including author, title,
			opinion and some other information. Polish version. This context makes use an additional ontology which defines some literary concepts (genres, physical media, etc.)
	</ul>
	</div>
	<h4>Ontologies</h4>
	<div>
		<li><a href="ontologies/BooksTypesGenresAndStylesOntology_pl.owl">BooksTypesGenresAndStylesOntology_pl.owl</a> - an ontology that collects literature genres useful for 
			expressing information about read books. Watch out! This ontology contains Polish names of concepts/individuals to be easily used in JSON-LD descriptions.
			I consider this ontology a work-in-progress which will evolve, however I'll try to keep the vocabulary as stable as possible.
