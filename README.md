# Ontologies - a repository for ontologies and contexts.

Both contexts and ontologies are available at the Github pages site: <https://michalroj.github.io/ontologies/>.

They can be used directly from Github pages since their IRIs are the same as their location. For instance, ontology
PublicationFormsOntology has IRI as follows: "https://michalroj.github.io/ontologies/ontologies/PublicationFormsOntology.ttl" and
is accessed at [this very location](https://michalroj.github.io/ontologies/ontologies/PublicationFormsOntology.ttl). 
Thus it can be used in prefixes (such as in [the following context file](https://michalroj.github.io/ontologies/contexts/personal_reading_log_context.jsonld)) 
as well as it can be loaded and parsed.

Similarly, the context files can be used directly as IRIs. Example use of such context file is 
in this [example personal reading log (in Polish)](https://michalroj.github.io/ontologies/examples/read_books_zajdel_2024.jsonld).
